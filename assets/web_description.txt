Tired of pressing Space and accidentally skipping ahead, restarting a movie, or triggering a random button? Frustrated that keyboard shortcuts stop working after exiting fullscreen?

Stream Keys fixes broken keyboard behavior on streaming sites. Your shortcuts always do what you expect—play, pause, toggle subtitles, or go fullscreen—no matter what's focused on the page.

Supported Services:
Disney+ • HBO Max • BBC iPlayer • YouTube

Key Features:

• Space always plays or pauses, even when a button is focused
• F toggles fullscreen—and shortcuts keep working after you exit
• C toggles subtitles based on your preferred languages
• Arrow keys rewind or fast-forward on Disney+ and BBC iPlayer
• Media keys work for play/pause and skipping

Never Lose Your Place—Position Restore:

Press R to instantly jump back to where you were. Perfect for when you overshoot a skip, accidentally seek too far, or want to rewatch a scene and then return.

The position menu shows:
• Your starting position when the video loaded
• Up to 3 recent positions saved before you seeked
• How long ago each position was saved
• One-key access (press 1, 2, or 3 to jump)

Stream Keys automatically saves positions whenever you use the timeline or skip buttons—so there's always somewhere to go back to. It's like undo for video navigation.

Customizable:

• Set your preferred subtitle languages in the extension settings
• Configure custom skip duration (5–120 seconds)
• Enable or disable individual services
• Turn off position history tracking if you don't need it

Lightweight, privacy-friendly, and unobtrusive. No tracking, no ads—just reliable keyboard shortcuts.
