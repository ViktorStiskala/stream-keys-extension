Stream Keys makes familiar YouTube-style keyboard shortcuts work reliably on Disney+ and HBO Max.
Space always toggles play and pause, F toggles fullscreen, C manages subtitles, and R lets you jump back to recent
positions.

Many streaming sites have frustrating keyboard behavior. Pressing Space while a random button is focused can
skip forward, restart the movie from the beginning, or trigger the wrong action instead of pausing.
After you leave fullscreen, keyboard shortcuts often stop working until you click the page again,
which can also pause or seek the video.

Stream Keys listens for shortcuts at the top level of the page instead of relying on whichever element is focused.
Your keys keep working consistently in fullscreen and after you exit fullscreen, even when the site UI changes.

Features:

• Space always toggles play and pause, no matter which button is focused
• F toggles fullscreen and keeps keyboard shortcuts working even after you exit fullscreen
• C toggles subtitles based on your preferred languages
• R opens a simple panel with your recent positions so you can quickly jump back if you overshoot a seek
• Keyboard shortcuts work on both Disney+ and HBO Max
• Optional position history tracking that you can turn off in the extension settings
• Settings page to configure preferred subtitle languages
• Lightweight extension with minimal, unobtrusive UI
