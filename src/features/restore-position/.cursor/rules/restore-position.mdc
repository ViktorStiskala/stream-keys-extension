# Position Restore Feature Notes

## Position History Algorithm

### State Management
- `positionHistory`: Array of { time, label, savedAt } entries
- `loadTimePosition`: Position when video first loaded (captured after initial resume)
- `SEEK_MAX_HISTORY`: Maximum entries to keep (3)
- `SEEK_MIN_DIFF_SECONDS`: Minimum difference between saved positions (15 seconds)

### Debounce Logic for Seeks
- `SEEK_DEBOUNCE_MS`: 5 seconds window for grouping rapid seeks
- Only the position before the FIRST seek in a sequence is saved
- Keyboard/button seeks use debouncing, timeline clicks save immediately
- Flag `isKeyboardOrButtonSeek` distinguishes seek sources

### Position Recording Rules
1. Don't save positions < 15 seconds into video
2. Don't save if too close to load time position
3. Don't save if too close to ANY existing saved position
4. Timeline clicks bypass debounce logic

## Load Time Position Capture

Capture happens on `canplay`, `playing`, or `seeked` events:
1. Wait 1 second for player to settle
2. Only capture if position >= 15 seconds
3. Mark video ready for tracking after 500ms delay (avoids recording initial resume seek)

## Dialog State Management

### Toggle Behavior
- Pressing R when dialog is open closes it
- Pressing R when closed opens it
- ESC key closes dialog and prevents fullscreen exit

### Key Handling in Dialog
- Number keys 0-3 select corresponding position
- R or ESC closes dialog
- Modifier keys (Cmd, Ctrl) pass through for browser shortcuts

### Real-time Updates
- Current time display updates every 300ms
- Relative time ("2m 30s ago") updates live
- Use `tabular-nums` for stable number widths

## Video Time Tracking

### Two-Timestamp System with Delayed Capture

For services like Disney+ where the UI updates before `video.seeking` becomes true, we use a two-timestamp system:

- `_streamKeysLastKnownTime`: Always current, updated every RAF frame
- `_streamKeysStableTime`: Delayed by ~500ms, guaranteed to be pre-seek value

The stable time is updated using delayed capture with `setTimeout`:
```typescript
const track = () => {
  const newTime = getActualPlaybackTime(currentVideo);
  currentVideo._streamKeysLastKnownTime = newTime;

  // Schedule stable time update with captured value (every ~200ms)
  if (now - lastStableSchedule >= STABLE_TIME_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL_MS) {
    const capturedTime = newTime; // Frozen at this moment
    setTimeout(() => {
      currentVideo._streamKeysStableTime = capturedTime; // Used 500ms later
    }, STABLE_TIME_DELAY_MS);
    lastStableSchedule = now;
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(track);
};
```

The key insight: the value passed to `setTimeout` is captured at scheduling time, not read when the timeout fires. This eliminates race conditions where the UI updates before `video.seeking` becomes true.

After seek completes (`seeked` event), both times are synced to the current position.

### Getting Pre-Seek Position

Use `_streamKeysGetStableTime()` method which provides consistent fallback:
```typescript
video._streamKeysGetStableTime = () => {
  return video._streamKeysStableTime ??
         video._streamKeysLastKnownTime ??
         video._streamKeysGetPlaybackTime?.() ??
         video.currentTime;
};
```

This method is used by both keyboard seeks and timeline/UI seeks for consistent behavior.

### Video Element Properties

- `_streamKeysLastKnownTime`: Current position (updated every frame)
- `_streamKeysStableTime`: Delayed position (~500ms behind, pre-seek safe)
- `_streamKeysGetPlaybackTime()`: Returns actual playback time (uses custom logic for services like Disney+)
- `_streamKeysGetStableTime()`: Returns stable time with fallback chain
- `_streamKeysSeekListenerAdded`: Prevents duplicate listeners
- `_streamKeysReadyForTracking`: True after initial load complete
