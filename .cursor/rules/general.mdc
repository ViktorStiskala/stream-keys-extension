├── Makefile             # Build script with hardcoded file paths
├── handlers/
│   ├── base.js          # Shared base handler with common functionality
│   ├── disney.js        # Disney+ service configuration
│   └── hbomax.js        # HBO Max service configuration
└── settings/
    ├── settings.html    # Options page UI
    ├── settings.js      # Settings page logic (storage, drag-drop)
    └── settings.css     # Settings page styles
```

## Adding New Streaming Services

1. Create new handler in `handlers/` folder (e.g., `netflix.js`)
2. Use `window.StreamKeys.createHandler(config)` with service-specific config
3. Add URL matching in `main.js` router
4. Add host permissions in `manifest.json`
5. Add handler file to `Makefile` PACKAGE_FILES list
6. Create service-specific Cursor rules file

## Base Handler Configuration

Service handlers provide a config object to `createHandler()`:

```javascript
window.StreamKeys.createHandler({
  name: 'Service Name',
  getPlayer: () => { /* return player element */ },
  getButton: (keyCode) => { /* return button for key */ },
  setupPlayerFocus: (player) => { /* optional: custom focus logic */ },
  onPlayerSetup: (player) => { /* optional: called on player setup */ },
  getOverlayContainer: () => { /* optional: container for click overlay */ },
  subtitles: {
    getAvailable: () => { /* return [{label, element, ...}] */ },
    getCurrentState: () => { /* return true if subtitles on */ },
    turnOff: () => { /* click off option */ },
    selectLanguage: (item) => { /* click language option */ }
  }
});
```

## Settings & Storage

- Settings stored in `chrome.storage.sync` under key `subtitleLanguages`
- Default languages: `['English', 'English [CC]', 'English CC']`
- Settings injected as `window.__streamKeysSettings` before handlers load
- Access in handlers via `window.__streamKeysSettings.subtitleLanguages`

## Keyboard Event Capture Strategy

1. Use `window.addEventListener('keydown', handler, true)` - the capture phase (`true`) intercepts events before they reach other handlers
2. `window` is preferred over `document` as it's higher in the capture chain
3. Also attach listener to `document.fullscreenElement` when in fullscreen mode
4. Attach listener directly to the player element as additional fallback

## Browser Security: Fullscreen Exit Focus Issue

**Problem:** After exiting fullscreen, browsers require "user activation" (a real click) before routing keyboard events to the page. This is a security feature that cannot be bypassed with JavaScript - `element.focus()`, synthetic events, and other tricks do not satisfy this requirement.

**Solution:** Create an invisible full-page overlay after fullscreen exit that captures the user's first click:
- Overlay covers entire viewport with `z-index: 2147483647`
- Completely transparent so user doesn't notice
- Captures click, removes itself, then focuses the player
- Click doesn't propagate to video (avoids unwanted pause/play)

## Script Injection

The background script injects in this order:
1. Settings as global variable (`window.__streamKeysSettings`)
2. Base handler (`handlers/base.js`)
3. Service-specific handler

All injected into MAIN world to share context with the streaming service's scripts.

## Logging Convention

- `console.info('[StreamKeys] ...')` - Extension loaded messages
- `console.warn('[StreamKeys] ...')` - Button not found or other recoverable issues

## Build System

The `Makefile` contains hardcoded file paths in `PACKAGE_FILES`. When changing project structure or adding new required files, update these paths manually.

## Manifest Constraints

- The `description` field in `manifest.json` has a maximum length of 132 characters.
